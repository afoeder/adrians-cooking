# Mapo Tofu

## Yadda yadda intro
This is a dish I've get to known in a Stuttgart restaurant which quickly became my favourite. I never made the effort to research what it really is, until I think I've [seen it](https://www.instagram.com/p/CaIw6NdPDxp/) on Kenji's Instagram.

Following Kenji's traces I found a [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AI8YPammTo) by him cooking it; and following further I realized there's a Serious Eats [recipe published](https://www.seriouseats.com/real-deal-mapo-dofu-tofu-chinese-sichuan-recipe). I was satisfied so far but my attention got to a [comment](https://www.seriouseats.com/real-deal-mapo-dofu-tofu-chinese-sichuan-recipe#comment-5523380302) in the comments section where the [author `xiaozi`](https://disqus.com/by/xiaozi/) is claiming some incorrectnesses in chinese authenticity.

### Broad bean paste

Both Kenji and `xiaozi` say the proper paste to use is _Pixiandouban_, what this exactly means remains to be seen, the naming varies. Here's some links to it:

### Fermented black beans

They seem to be a side dish, here's a source:

### Bean starch

apparently a.k.a. Mung bean starch

### Chili oil

Use "crisp chili oil", e.g. LAO Gan Ma brand.
