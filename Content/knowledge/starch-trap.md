#  The starch trap

There is a concept I have first learned from Heston Blumenthal calling it "starch trap". The technique seemingly was first described in <cite>Jeffrey Steingarten, The Man Who Ate Everything (1997)</cite>.

The science basically is that starch absorbs water when being heated, causing it to swell and turn into a gel. The swelling eventually breaks the "walls" around them, causing the gel to leak and eventually turn everything into a gummy. We want to avoid this, i.e. keep the "walls" intact.
A super detailed write-up is on a [reddit comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/hqyea7/comment/fy0z5w9/).


## Steps

1. Peel potatoes, cut into equal pieces, perhaps 1″ each
2. Sous-vide for 30′ in (unsalted) water of 72.5&#x202F;°C
3. Drain them, rinse and let sit in cold tap water for 30′, perhapse fridged
4. Finally cook them in boiling water until falling apart
