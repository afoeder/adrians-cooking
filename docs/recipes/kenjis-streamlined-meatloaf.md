## Introduction and source notes

I’ve found this recipe on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/qws7VGet1A4). These are my notes while following along cooking it.

## Directions

Preheat oven to 175&#x202F;°C.

### The loaf

Put in a bowl and mix by hand into a paste:

* 100&#x202F;g Bread (following 1:10 ratio bread:meat)
    * I've once soaked a pretzel and topped up with Panko.
* 1 egg
* ½—¾ cup buttermilk
* pinch of salt
* ground pepper
* 2 tbsp powdered gelatin (~13&#x202F;g)
* if you like, ½ tsp instant beef broth

Make a mirepoix with butter of chopped…:

* onions
* carrots
* celery

Add the paste in a bowl with

* 300&#x202F;g ground beef
* 300&#x202F;g ground pork
* 300&#x202F;g ground veal
* 1&#x202F;tbsp soy sauce
* dash of Worcestershire sauce
* ~10-12&#x202F;g of salt (about 1&#x202F;%)
* pepper
* the mirepoix
* ~120&#x202F;g grated (mozzarella) cheese. The cheese should be really fine and not these long sauerkraut-y strings: these do not mix well. 

…and knead it until it is homogenous. Do not overmix.

Turn out the mass onto a sheet with parchment paper.

Wet hands with water and form a nice loaf. The ends should be relatively square to not have too tiny ends.

Put it into an oven at 60&#x202F;°C (140&#x202F;°F) for 35–40′.

### The glaze

Add in the mirepoix pan

* ~½—¾ cup of ketchup
* equal amount of brown sugar
* splash of cider vinegar
* splash of worcestershire sauce
* dash of soy sauce

Bring it to simmer, taste it, let cool.

### Glazing

Check the core temp of loaf to be 60&#x202F;°C (140&#x202F;°F).

Turn the oven to max.

Brush glazing onto loaf, back into oven for 3′.

Apply a second coat of glazing, back into the oven for 3′.

Add a final layer, repeat.

Let rest until core temp of 65-66&#x202F;°C (150&#x202F;°F)

Transfer to cutting board, slice.
