# Tajin

[https://www.tajin.com/](https://www.tajin.com/)

This is an amazing seasoning for a fresh summery salad. Chop up some or all of: cucumber, tomato, (red) pointed or bell pepper, celery, radishes, iceberg lettuce and season with nothing but a generous dash of Tajin.

Squeeze a lemon and add its whole peel if youâ€™re feeling extra fresh.
