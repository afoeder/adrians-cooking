## Style guide

In accordance to the SI-standard a value and unit should be separated by a narrow no-break space (NNBSP), in HTML/MD this would be done with `&#x202F;`.

Minutes/seconds or inches etc. should be represented with the actual [Prime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_(symbol)), i.e. ′ or ″ respectively.
