## Style guide

In accordance to the SI-standard a value and unit should be separated by a narrow no-break space (NNBSP), in HTML/MD this would be done with `&#x202F;`.

Minutes/seconds or inches etc. should be represented with the actual Prime[^prime], i.e. ′ or ″ respectively.

Fraction numbers must be represented by their unicode "vulgar fraction" counterparts[^vulgfract], e.g. ⅛, ¼, ½, ⅔, ¾
