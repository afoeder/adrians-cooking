# Kenji's streamlined meatloaf

## Introduction and source notes

I've found this recipe on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/qws7VGet1A4). These are my notes following along.

## Directions

Preheat oven to 60°&#x202F;C.

### The loaf

Put in a bowl and mix by hand into a paste:

* [ ] 100&#x202F;g Bread,
* [ ] 1 egg
* [ ] ½ cup buttermelk
* pinch of salt
* ground pepper
* [ ] 2 tbsp powdered gelatene

Make a mirepoix with butter of chopped…:

* [ ] onions
* [ ] carrots
* [ ] celery
* [ ] garlic

Add the paste in a bowl with

* [ ] 500&#x202F;g ground beef
* [ ] 500&#x202F;g ground pork
* [ ] 1&#x202F;tbsp soy sauce
* [ ] dash of Worceshire sauce
* ~10-12&#x202F;g of salt (about 1&#x202F;%)
* pepper
* the mirepoix
* [ ] ~120&#x202F;g grated (mozzarella) cheese

and knead it until it's homogenous. Don't overmix.

Turn out the mass onto a sheet with parchment paper.

Wet hands with water and form a nice loaf. The ends should be relatively square to not have too tiny ends.

Put it into an oven at 60°&#x202F;C (140°&#x202F;F) for 35-40′.

### The glaze

Add in the mirepox pan

* [ ] ~½—¾ cup of ketchup
* [ ] equal amount brown sugar
* [ ] splash of cider vinegar
* [ ] splash of worcestershire sauce
* [ ] dash of soy sauce

Bring it to simmer, taste it, let cool.

### Glazing

Check core temp of loaf to be 60&#x202F;°C (140&#x202F;°F).

Turn oven to max.

Brush glazing onto loaf, back into oven for 3′.

Apply second coat of glazing, back into oven for 3′.

Add a final layer, repeat.

Let rest until core temp of 65-66&#x202F;°C (150&#x202F;°F)

Transfer to cutting board, slice.
