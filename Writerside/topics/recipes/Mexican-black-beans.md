# Mexican Black Beans

## Ingredients

* I use ⅔ of a cup dried black beans for two side portions
* 1 tsp dried Mexican oregano
* 1–2 thyme leaves
* clove of garlic
* A generous dash each of ground…
  * Paprika
  * Smoked Paprika
  * Cayenne pepper
  * Cumin
  * Salt
  * Pepper

## Directions

1. In a saucepan, add beans and generously cover in water, about 1–2 inches
2. While bringing to a boil, add all the seasoning
3. When boiling, kill heat to low (2/9) and put on lid
4. peek-a-boo from time to time, stir, and make sure the sauce is bubbling gently. Adjust heat accordingly.
5. Wait until beans are soft to taste: you can also feel this while stirring. This might take 1 hour to 3+ depending on the nature of the beans.

> People often soak overnight to reduce the overall cooking time and therefore also the energy cost, which is a legitimate desire.
> I don’t usually do this due to the lack of spontaneity.
> In any case, I wouldn’t throw away the soaking water because I think it contains lots of tasty aromatics already.
> If you’re concerned about dirt, rinse the dry beans at the very beginning.
