# Rösti

Rösti is a Swiss dish made of potatoes. I like it as a feast day breakfast along
with bacon, egg, [Mexican Black Beans](Mexican-black-beans.md), etc.

## Ingredients

* a few peeled potatoes, waxy, as large as possible (easier peeling). Consider 120&#x202F;g ± per person
* nutmeg, salt, pepper, to taste

## Directions

* Grate potatoes coarsely

* stir in nutmeg, salt, pepper
  > There is no need to put in additional starch flour, also no need
  > to squeeze out excess water.

* Slowly bring an iron pan to piping heat, add quite a lot of olive oil, kill to medium-high (about 7/9)
* Grab a portion of the seasoned grated potatoes with your fist and place it in the pan, repeat for each portion
* With a spatula, separate each portion, bring them into shape, and flatly press on top of them

* Let the Maillard reaction do its magic: wait a couple of minutes until the bottom side gets hard and crispy.
  You now can carefully scrape the Rösti from the pan. Swirl them around a bit so they get in contact with still-hot areas on the pan
* Switch back to high (9/9), give the pan a few seconds to suck in the heat
* Flip the Rösti with the help of the spatula, pressing them again against the bottom of the pan afterward
* Again kill the heat to med-high (~7/9) and wait until done. You want the Rösti like medium-rare :)
