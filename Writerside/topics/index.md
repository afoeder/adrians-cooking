# Adrian’s cooking

* This is a collection of recipes and cooking knowledge that I have acquired over the years. I try to have cooked every
    recipe in here, but am often too lazy to photograph it. So it’s sometimes just a theoretical bunch of cooking directions.\
    _Update August 2024_\
    Over the time the scope of this page has crept a bit towards “everything gastronomic,” so there is also general knowledge,
    whatever. I might also add restaurant critics, kitchen gear, etc.
