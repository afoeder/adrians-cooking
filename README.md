# My Recipes

Through the years I have collected some recipes either passed down from relatives or researched and adjusted for my taste or what I've considered authentic.

In an attempt to store them as well as possible, this is it.

### Writerside

At some point I've decided to give "Writerside" a try. All information is located in the folder `./Writerside`. The building happens by the `.github/workflows/build-docs.yml` file; it's basically what is described on the Docs for GH pages: https://www.jetbrains.com/help/writerside/deploy-docs-to-github-pages.html

The CNAME in the content root is for GitHub Pages.
